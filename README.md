# Math Police.
My first game! Entirely made with Python and a "Calculator" made with Java, I hope you enjoy!
# Basic Instructions
There are different difficulties and different worlds.
You can choose your world by responding with 1, 2, 3, or 4 at the world selection prompt.
You can choose what difficulty you want by responding to the difficulty input prompt with, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", or "Insane"; difficulties like "Godlike" and "Final Boss" are exlcusive to World 4.

# Prerequisites:
You must have Python 3.
We recommend always having the latest version of Python as well as having the latest version of PyCharm (Community or Professional Edition). Any other Python IDE is okay but you may need to do it differently.
You may need pygame directly installed on your computer.

# Rules:

DO NOT ANSWER PROBLEMS USING ANY CAPITAL LETTERS. It will be counted as incorrect.

You must translate words into numerical values.
You translate words letter by letter.
The value of a letter corresponds to their order in the alphabet.
For example, A is the first letter in the alphabet so A = 1
and B is the second letter in the alphabet so B = 2 and so on and so on.
To translate a word, you must add up the values of each letter.
So the word "in" would be equal to 9 + 14, because i is the 9th letter in the alphabet and n is the 14th.

# Difficulties:

### Worlds 1-4:

Easy: 3 to 6-letter words.

Medium: 7 to 9-letter words

Hard: 10 to 12-letter words

Insane: 13 to 16-letter words

##### Exclusive to World 4:

Godlike: 27-45 letter words

Final Boss: 183 letters

##### I have decided not word sizes and difficuties for Worlds 2-4 YET.
# Extras:
Attached In the main branch is a file called "The Calculating Method". This is the java code used to calculate the "Word Value" (The numerical value of the word in this game). I would also like to mention a few things.
This java code seems to only work with this online compiler:
https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler
And, you can only use lowercase letters.

# OST Importing:
When the update gets released, the OST will be added to the project. If you have PyCharm, run Math Police using PyCharm. Then move the songs from the folder into the PycharmProject that contains the game. 
It should look like this:

Then the music for each world should play when you open the file and choose the world!
# Credits:
A great thanks to my brother for making the calculating method for my game. And even more thanks to Colby, and old friend of my brothers' who came up with the game of Math Police. A small game that you could play in a car turned into one of my most ambitious coding projects. It was thanks to him that I learned so much from creating Math Police.
